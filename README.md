Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?The fundamentals concept of version control include:
        .Repository(Repo)-A storage location of all files,code and their version history
        .Commit-A snapshot of changes made to the code at a specific point in time.
        .Branching-Creating a separate line of development from the main project,which can later be merged.
        .Merging-Combining changes from different branches back into the main codebase.
        .Conflict Resolution-Managing situations where multiple peaople edit the same part of a file.
  Github is a popular tool for managing versions of code because of:
       .Issue Tracking-Helps manage bugs,feature requests, and tasks within the project.
       .Github securely stores code,preventing accidental losses or unauthorized changes.
       .Works with automation tools to test and deploy code efficiently.
       .Teams can review and discuss changes before merging them into the main branch.
       .Cloud-based Collaboration-Developers can work from anywhere and access the latest code versions.
  Version Control helps in maintaining project integrity by:
      .Preventing data loss
      .Ensures code quality-Through reveiews and automated testing,only stable codes gets merged into production.
      .Enhances collaboration-Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
      .Provides accountability-The history of commits shows who made what changes and when.
      .Developers can test new feauters in branches without affecting the main project.
